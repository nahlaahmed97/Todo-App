## Development server

Run `npm install` to install all packages and dependencies this project has to your local machine.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Workflow
- users: https://reqres.in/api/users
- todos: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

When status button is clicked, user can change the order of the list between ascending and descending orders.
When user click edit a edit modal opens and user can edit todo's title and status. When user click save todo's infromation changes.
